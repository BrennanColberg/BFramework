+ 'images' package option
+ Resources class for managing sounds and images
+ Image class [not to be confused with java.awt.Image]
+ BColor.all(##) creates color with all values ##
+ added direct call in State for object(i) [from objects().get(i)]
+ added static reference to pressed list - easy key conditions
+ heading and speed getters/setters for MovingEntity
+ Vector methods rotateNew, angleNew

* 'Sound' incorporated into 'Resource'
* moved BColor, Rect, Poly, and Line classes from com.bframework.c.math to com.bframework.c.graphics
* Entity.rectBounds() no longer abstract, returns null
* Entity.polyBounds() returns null
* CameraInput's 'speed()' actually affects speed now; before it was hardcoded and ignored that variable
* Rendering and ticking in state go new -> old not old -> new ... older render on top
	* blanket empty catches for NullPointerException and ClassCastException, IndexOutOfBoundsException ... such errors within tick() or render() methods will not show
		-> this is because of DeathAnimation in BGame TSA.0.0 removing or setting objects to null in the middle of the tick/render cycle
